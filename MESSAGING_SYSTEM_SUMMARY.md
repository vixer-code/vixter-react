## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users
1. **Navigate to Messages** (`/messages`) to access the messaging interface
2. **Switch between tabs**: Regular messages and Service conversations
3. **Start conversations** by visiting user profiles and clicking message
4. **Send media**: Click the paperclip icon to attach photos, videos, audio, or files
5. **Record voice messages**: Use the microphone option for audio recordings
6. **Reply to messages**: Right-click (or long-press on mobile) to reply
7. **Manage service orders**: Accept/decline orders directly in service chat

### For Developers
1. **Import contexts** in components that need messaging functionality
2. **Use messaging hooks** to access real-time data and actions
3. **Handle service orders** through the ServiceOrderContext
4. **Customize UI** by modifying the CSS files
5. **Extend functionality** by adding new message types or features

## 🔧 Firebase Setup Required

To fully activate the messaging system, you need to:

1. **Configure Firebase Realtime Database** with the provided rules
2. **Set up Firebase Storage** with appropriate security rules
3. **Implement Cloud Functions** for service order processing
4. **Update Firestore rules** for service order documents
5. **Configure push notifications** (optional but recommended)

Detailed setup instructions are available in `MESSAGING_FIREBASE_SETUP.md`.

## 🎯 Service Order Workflow

1. **User purchases service** → Service notification sent to vendor chat
2. **Vendor accepts/declines** → Buyer receives notification
3. **Service delivered** → Vendor marks as delivered
4. **Buyer confirms** → Payment released to vendor automatically
5. **Auto-release** → If no confirmation in 24h, payment auto-releases

## 🔒 Security Features

- **User authentication** required for all messaging operations
- **Conversation permissions** - only participants can read/write
- **Media validation** - file type and size restrictions
- **Secure uploads** - organized Firebase Storage with access controls
